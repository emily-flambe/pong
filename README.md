# Pong Game - Phase 4 Integration Complete

A web-based Pong game implemented with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, featuring a clean 3-layer architecture designed for future multiplayer extensibility.

## Implementation Status

✅ **Phase 4 - Integration Complete**
- Main Game class with requestAnimationFrame loop
- Canvas setup and initialization  
- deltaTime calculation for consistent physics
- 3-layer architecture coordination: InputHandler → GameState → Renderer

## Architecture

The game follows a modular 3-layer architecture:

```
Game.js (Main Orchestrator)
├── GameState.js (Pure game logic)
├── InputHandler.js (Keyboard input)  
└── Renderer.js (Canvas drawing)
```

### Main Game Class Features

- **Canvas Management**: Automatic canvas setup with proper sizing (800x600)
- **Game Loop**: 60fps requestAnimationFrame loop with deltaTime calculation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and browser compatibility checks
- **Lifecycle Management**: Start, pause, resume, stop, and reset functionality
- **Browser Events**: Handles visibility changes, window resize, and focus management
- **Debug Mode**: Optional debug information display (FPS, deltaTime)

### Integration Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Game constructor sets up canvas, initializes all components
2. **Update Cycle**: InputHandler → GameState.update() → Renderer.render()
3. **Timing**: Delta time calculation prevents frame-rate dependent physics
4. **Error Recovery**: Try-catch blocks around critical operations with graceful degradation

## File Structure

```
/
├── index.html          # Game entry point with controls
├── game.js            # Main Game class (IMPLEMENTED)
├── GameState.js       # Pure game logic (REQUIRED)
├── InputHandler.js    # Keyboard input handler (REQUIRED)  
├── Renderer.js        # Canvas rendering (REQUIRED)
└── README.md         # This file
```

## Required Dependencies

The main Game class expects these components to be implemented:

- **GameState**: Must have `update(deltaTime, inputState)`, `getState()`, `setState()`, `reset()` methods
- **InputHandler**: Must have `getInputState()` method returning current input state
- **Renderer**: Must have `render(gameState)` method for drawing the game

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Click "Start" to begin the game
3. Use arrow keys to control the paddle
4. Use control buttons for pause/resume/reset functionality

## Browser Compatibility

- Requires HTML5 Canvas support
- Requires requestAnimationFrame API
- Tested on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Next Steps

With the main Game class complete, implement the remaining components:

1. **GameState.js** - Ball physics, paddle movement, collision detection
2. **InputHandler.js** - Arrow key input processing  
3. **Renderer.js** - Canvas drawing operations for ball, paddle, and boundaries

## Debug Features

- Enable debug mode to see FPS and deltaTime information
- Console logging for game state transitions
- Error messages displayed in UI for user feedback

The architecture is designed to be network-ready for future multiplayer implementation with Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects.
